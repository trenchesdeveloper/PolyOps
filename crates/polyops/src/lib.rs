//! # PolyOps
//!
//! Boolean operations on polygons via the Martinez-Rueda-Feito sweep-line
//! algorithm. Faithful Rust port of
//! [`martinez-polygon-clipping`](https://github.com/w8r/martinez).
//!
//! ## Operations
//!
//! - [`intersection`] — the area covered by **both** subject and clipping.
//! - [`union`] — the area covered by **either** subject or clipping.
//! - [`difference`] — the area in subject **but not** in clipping.
//! - [`xor`] — the area in subject **xor** clipping (symmetric difference).
//!
//! All four accept GeoJSON-shaped coordinate arrays: either a `Polygon`
//! (`Vec<Ring>`) or a `MultiPolygon` (`Vec<Polygon>`), via the [`Geometry`]
//! enum.
//!
//! ## Status
//!
//! Pre-alpha. The public surface is stable; the algorithm itself is not yet
//! implemented. See the crate's `tests/parity.rs` for the correctness bar.
